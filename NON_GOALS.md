# Proof of Non-Existence (PNE) — Non-Goals

This document defines what Proof of Non-Existence (PNE) is explicitly not
designed to do.

PNE proves absence. It does not repair, prevent, or explain.

---

## PNE Does Not Delete Anything

PNE does not:
- Remove files
- Wipe storage
- Modify systems
- Enforce retention policies

PNE verifies non-existence only.

---

## PNE Does Not Monitor Systems

PNE does not:
- Run continuously
- Observe systems over time
- Detect future creation
- Maintain long-lived state

All claims are evaluated at a declared point in time and scope.

---

## PNE Does Not Prove Intent

PNE does not:
- Infer user or system intent
- Explain why something does not exist
- Attribute cause or responsibility

Only observable absence is evaluated.

---

## PNE Does Not Make Probabilistic Claims

PNE does not:
- Estimate likelihood
- Use statistical inference
- Say “probably never existed”
- Accept partial confidence

If proof cannot be established, PNE refuses.

---

## PNE Does Not Trust External Assertions

PNE does not:
- Accept unverifiable attestations
- Trust vendor or operator claims
- Assume correctness of logs without scope

All assertions must be backed by evidence.

---

## PNE Does Not Expand Scope

PNE does not:
- Infer missing boundaries
- Fill evidence gaps
- Relax scope definitions
- Broaden claims implicitly

Insufficient scope results in `OUT_OF_SCOPE`.

---

## Summary

Proof of Non-Existence is intentionally narrow.

Its value comes from refusing claims it cannot prove.
